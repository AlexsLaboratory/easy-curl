## üßê About <a name="about"></a>

---
This project was created to help developers easily interact with the underlying cURL API.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

---
These instructions will get you a copy of Easy Curl up and running.

### Prerequisites

In order to install this package you have to install `composer` which can be done by following the steps based on your system [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

If you have not done so already run `composer init` in the root of your project directory, do so now to start using composer. Just follow the prompts as they appear.

### Installing

To install Easy Curl run the command below while in your project root.

```php
composer require lowem/easy-curl
```

Create a new PHP file and add the code below to the top of the file to automatically load in the package as well as any others you may have installed. The `use` statement prevents you from having to type in the full namespace of the package.

```php
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";
use Lowem\EasyCurl\EasyCurl;
```
